# Techniques for Data Visualization

### Project Overview

This project aims to perform different data visualization techniques on a heart disease dataset to understand the distribution and relationships between various features. The insights gained from this analysis will help in building and evaluating a model for the early detection of heart disease.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis contains the following features:

- `Age:` Age of the patient in years.
- `Sex:` Gender of the patient (Male or Female).
- `ChestPainType:` Type of chest pain experienced (Typical Angina, Atypical Angina, Non-Anginal Pain, Asymptomatic).
- `RestingBP:` Resting blood pressure in mm Hg.
- `Cholesterol:` Serum cholesterol level in mg/dl.
- `FastingBS:` Fasting blood sugar level (1 if > 120 mg/dl, 0 otherwise).
- `RestingECG:` Results of the resting electrocardiogram (Normal, ST-T wave abnormality, Left ventricular hypertrophy).
- `MaxHR:` Maximum heart rate achieved.
- `ExerciseAngina:` Presence of exercise-induced angina (Yes or No).
- `Oldpeak:` Depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
- `ST_Slope:` Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Upsloping, Flat, Downsloping).
- `HeartDisease:` Target variable indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.
